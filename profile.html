				<h2>Mickey the Debug Dog</h2>
				<p>Many a programmer have heard of Rubber Duck Debugging. But they do not know the invincible power of a Debug Dog.</p>
				<p>Dogs are known in many cultures as men and women's best friends. Most cultures rate these mythical creatures as above average intelligence, making them especially good at helping to debug those tough problems in your code.</p>
				<p><strong>Real Name:</strong> GOSIG GOLDEN by Ikea</p>
				<p><strong>Birthdate/"Gotcha Day":</strong> Born © 2001 in China, but found at a rummage sale in Seattle, WA in March of 2012.</p>
				<p><strong>Powers:</strong> As Douglas Adams once said “One is never alone with a rubber duck.” Mickey, the Debug Dog is a patient listener, able to help you solve your debugging woes. Unlike a rubber duck, Mickey is also soft and cuMickeyly, doubling as a pillow for those occasional times you need to just close your eyes for a 5 minute power nap.</p>
